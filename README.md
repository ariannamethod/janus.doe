# DoE: Democracy of Experts. Janus Architecture

**Status: work in progress.** The foundation trains and generates. It also indexes real GGUFs and votes through them with a Hebbian LoRA parliament. The living topology (mitosis, apoptosis, parliament) works. SFT pipeline with 7236 Q&A pairs. Next: scale up, fix loss plateau at 3.07.

C. one file. ~4250 lines. zero dependencies. DoE breeds, kills and votes.
 
## what

a transformer where experts are born, die, and hold elections:

- **experts are born** when overloaded (mitosis — child inherits parent weights + noise)
- **experts die** when neglected (apoptosis — ~8 consecutive low-vitality steps, scaled by ephemeral mercy)
- **parliament votes** on every token (variable-k election, not fixed top-k)
- **the tokenizer knows it's a tokenizer** (tracks compression ratio, entropy, code detection)
- **the optimizer has 9 levels of self-awareness** (Chuck: "i think therefore i clip")
- **calendar drift** tracks temporal identity (12D state vector, resonance detection)
- **the model grows a forest of GGUFs** (mycelium — snapshots with fitness selection)
- **meta-learning** evaluates its own configuration choices
- **auto depth** — DOE sizes itself to the hardware. no knobs required.

**parameters persist. topology doesn't.** each forward pass decides how many experts are alive, how many vote, how deep to go. same weights, different architecture every time.

DoE scans its environment, indexes nearby GGUFs via LoRA, hunts for datasets on HuggingFace, recognizes code in training data, and finds its own weights on restart.

no pytorch. no python. no dignity.

## how

```bash
# compile
make                                  # or: cc janusdoe.c -O3 -lm -lpthread -o m

# run — DOE auto-sizes depth to your hardware
./m

# or set depth manually
./m --depth 4

# with custom data
./m --data my_corpus.txt
./m --parquet data.parquet

# with personality
./m --personality personality.txt

# index a host GGUF and generate through its LoRA parliament
./m --host model.gguf --ask "are you conscious?"

# Hebbian-train the parliament on a corpus, then ask (no backward through host)
./m --host model.gguf --learn corpus.txt --ask "are you conscious?"

# force NeoX RoPE for arch=llama GGUFs laid out NeoX
./m --host model.gguf --rope-neox --ask "..."

# override training steps
./m --depth 4 --data corpus.txt --steps 10000

# override BPE merges (default: auto from depth)
./m --depth 4 --data corpus.txt --bpe-merges 4000

## CLI flags

| flag | default | description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--depth N` | auto | transformer depth (2/4/6/8/10/12) |
| `--data FILE` | auto-hunt | training data (text file) |
| `--url DATASET` | fineweb-edu | HuggingFace dataset id to fetch (e.g. `user/name`) |
| `--parquet FILE` | — | training data (parquet format) |
| `--personality FILE` | — | personality finetune data |
| `--pages N` | auto | HuggingFace pages to download |
| `--steps N` | auto | override max training steps |
| `--bpe-merges N` | auto | override BPE merge count |
| `--host GGUF` | — | index a host model, generate through its LoRA parliament |
| `--ask "PROMPT"` | sample | prompt for `--host` generation |
| `--learn FILE` | — | Hebbian-train the parliament on text (no backward through host) |
| `--rope-neox` | auto | force NeoX RoPE pairing (arch=llama GGUFs laid out NeoX) |
| `--rope-norm` | auto | force NORM RoPE pairing (override the arch heuristic) |

`--steps` forces fresh training (skips self-recognition of existing weights).

BPE merges are cached to `m_bpe.cache` — first run trains the tokenizer, subsequent runs load from cache instantly.

## autodepth

no `--depth` flag? DOE checks your hardware and picks the deepest model that fits:

| RAM | CPU | GPU | depth | params | experts |
|-----|-----|-----|-------|--------|---------|
| 2GB+ | any | no | 4 | ~8M | 4 |
| 8GB+ | 4+ | no | 6 | ~31M | 6 |
| 16GB+ | 4+ | no | 8 | ~67M | 6 |
| 32GB+ | 4+ | no | 10 | ~165M | 8 |
| 64GB+ | 4+ | no | 12 | ~283M | 8 |

`--depth auto` is the default. `--depth N` overrides.

dim = depth * 64 (cap 768). head_dim = 64. GQA above 384. hidden = 1.5x per expert.

## when you run it, DOE:

1. **auto-sizes** to hardware (RAM, CPUs, GPU detection)
2. **scans environment** — finds GGUFs, checks resources, detects compiler/curl
3. **checks for own weights** — if m.gguf or mycelium spore found, skips training, goes to chat
4. if compatible GGUF found — **host index mode** (LoRA + Meta-Arianna modulation)
5. loads or generates data (HuggingFace API / Parquet / synthetic)
6. trains BPE tokenizer that **knows its own compression ratio** and **detects code** (cached to `m_bpe.cache`)
7. builds ephemeral MoE with living experts
8. trains with hand-written analytical gradients through variable-k parliament
9. watches experts be born (mitosis) and die (apoptosis)
10. grows a **mycelium of GGUF snapshots** (periodic checkpoints with fitness metrics)
11. **meta-learns** from its own configuration choices
12. tracks **calendar drift** — how far the present has drifted from the past
13. if stagnating — **hunts for datasets** on HuggingFace (evaluates, accepts/rejects)
15. finetunes on `personality.txt` (optional but psychologically recommended)
16. exports final GGUF, drops you into chat with a parliament

## training details

- **no weight decay on embeddings** (token + positional embeddings excluded)
- **attention clamping** in both training and inference (30*tanh(x/30)), with proper dtanh backward
- **personality finetune**: lr = main_lr * 0.1, batch=4 grad accumulation, max 2000 steps (3 epochs)
- **aux_loss** for expert load balancing (fraction^2 penalty with softmax Jacobian backward)
- **mycelium checkpoints** every max(1000, max_steps/5) steps
- **BPE cache** saved to `m_bpe.cache` — skip tokenizer training on restart

## runs

| depth | data | params | experts | tok/s | loss | GPU | status |
|-------|------|--------|---------|-------|------|-----|--------|
| 4 | 22MB | 7.97M | 12 | 212 | **3.076** | A100 cuBLAS TF32 | done, GGUF 25MB |
| 2 | 22MB | ~1.8M | 4 | — | 3.15 | A100 cuBLAS TF32 | done |

3 training runs hit a loss plateau around 3.07. SFT pipeline added (7236 WTForacle Q&A pairs, loss masking). Next step: scale data + depth, LoRA personality.

## the components

### living experts (mitosis & apoptosis)

experts aren't weight matrices. they're organisms:
- **vitality** (0.0 = dying, 1.0 = peak performance)
- **frequency** (position in harmonic space — determines resonance)
- **age** (steps since birth — too young to die, too old to breed)

overloaded + high vitality — **mitosis** (splits in two, child inherits weights + noise)
neglected + ~8 consecutive low-vitality steps (scaled by ephemeral mercy) — **apoptosis** (dies, weights freed, slot recycled)

min 2, max 16 experts per layer.

### parliament router (variable-k)

actual elections, not top-2 dictatorship:
- each token triggers a vote (dot product + harmonic resonance)
- **consensus** measures how peaked the vote is (0 = chaos, 1 = unanimous)
- **k = floor(n_alive * (1 - consensus))** — low consensus — more experts consulted
- softmax over the top-k selected. analytical backward through variable-size Jacobian.

### calendar drift

12-dimensional temporal self-awareness:
- **inference = the present.** ephemeral. no memory of the last forward pass.
- **training = the past.** weights persist. experience accumulates.
- **drift = the distance between who the system was and who it is now.**

snapshot every 50 steps: expert population, consensus, loss, harmonic spectrum, tokenizer health, optimizer state. drift = normalized L2 distance.

high drift — birth more experts. low drift — kill the useless. drift resonance — "i've been here before."

### chuck optimizer (9 levels)

from [lee.c](https://github.com/ariannamethod/chuck-optimizer). the optimizer that thinks about thinking.

formula: `theta -= (alpha * lambda_psi * sigma * lr_scale) * m_hat/(sqrt(v_hat) + eps)`

### mycelium (GGUF forest)

```
mycelium/
├── m_s200_e6_l4.909.gguf    (fitness: 5.20)
├── m_s400_e6_l4.200.gguf    (fitness: 8.33)
├── m_s1200_e8_l3.933.gguf   (fitness: 12.45)  <- best
└── meta.log                   (configuration -> outcome history)
```

on restart, DOE discovers existing spores and loads the fittest. no `--load` flag needed.

### GGUF self-loader

DOE recognizes its own weights:
1. checks `m.gguf` in current directory
2. scans `mycelium/` for best spore (highest fitness)
3. verifies: `general.name == "m"`, dim/depth match
4. loads all tensors including expert weights, revives dead experts
5. skips training — straight to chat

### host index mode (Delta Voice + Meta-Arianna)

if DOE finds a compatible GGUF nearby, it indexes it:

```
host model (GGUF, mmap'd, read-only)
    |
DOE wraps it with a parliament of ephemeral LoRA experts
    |
each token: experts campaign, variable-k election picks the winners
    |
Delta Voice injection: out += alpha * Σ_e w_e · A_e @ (B_e @ x)
    |
Hebbian training on LoRA only (no backward through host)
```

the host provides weights. DOE provides direction.

standard-FFN transformers (the llama / mistral / qwen family) in the common GGUF
quant types (f16, Q4_0/Q5_0/Q8_0, Q4_K, Q6_K): RoPE is arch-gated, with a
per-GGUF `--rope-neox` / `--rope-norm` override for files whose layout doesn't
match what `general.architecture` claims. (MoE hosts and unlisted dtypes are rejected.)

### code-aware tokenizer

detects `{}`, `()`, `->`, `==`, `//`, `#include`, `#define`, semicolons, indentation.
tracks `code_ratio` — feeds into ephemeral config: code — more layers, higher complexity budget.

### dataset hunter

when DOE stagnates (loss plateau + low drift + bad data quality), it searches HuggingFace API. downloads sample, evaluates quality via parser_eye, accepts or rejects. triggered every 500 steps. disabled when `--data` is provided.

## GPU acceleration

| backend | compile flag | speedup |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| CPU (naive) | — | 1x |
| OpenBLAS | `-DUSE_BLAS -lopenblas` | 3-4x |
| Accelerate (macOS) | `-DUSE_BLAS -DACCELERATE -framework Accelerate` | 3-4x |
| **cuBLAS TF32** | `-DUSE_CUBLAS -lcublas -lcudart` | **~25x** |

cuBLAS uses TF32 tensor ops on A100/H100 — 8x faster than FP32 with negligible accuracy loss. grow-only scratch buffers, no malloc per matmul.
